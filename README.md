##Git Setup

In Your working directory type
`git init`

Then Checkout the repository
`git clone https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/LCA_Paper.git `

Download Files

`git pull`

##Git Use

Always do a `git pull` before starting work, just so you have the latest update

To add your changes

`git add <filename>`
or
`git add *`


Then commit the changes
`git commit -m "commit message"`

At this point it is good to run a `git pull` in case someone was working on the same file at the same time

Then push the changes
`git push origin master`
